  <h1> Project Spitfire</h2>
  <br>
  <h2>Backstory</h2>
  My father bought this Spitfire a long time ago as present for my mother.
  They have made a lot of trips to different countries in europa.
  I can also remember a ride with my father when I was 7 year old.
  In 2010 the car unfortunately broke down and was then taken to a car storage facility.
  After 14 years in 2024 my father told me", the only sun doing a technical study, 
  "do you want to repaire the Spitfire otherwise am I going to cell the car".
  And that was the moment the journy stated.<br>
  Below are the milestones of the process.

          In this month we transported the car from the storage facility to my parants driveway.
            You can see that the car had collected a of dust during the years. So the first step was cleaning the Spitefire.

            After a thorough cleaning session, the car looked a lot better.<br>

          Vintage cars often cannot be left outside in the winter. 
          Therefore, we moved it to a garage of Gijs' uncle during this month.
          This garage also has all the tools a man can dream about. Which might make repairing faster.

          This month we managed to get the Spitfire working. (see video)<br>
          Unfortunately, the Spitfire is not yet ready for the road.
          The clutch still needs to be done, so do the brakes, lights, handbrake and the interior.

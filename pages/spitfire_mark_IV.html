    <h2>June 2024</h2>
    I'm a Mechatronics Engineering Student, passionated to learn new things.
    With this website I want to show what give a look deeper into what I am doing/had done related to engineering.
    I also like to gain more knowledge. And I broaden this by, for example, doing courses such as Harvard's CS50 course.
